# SMM
The SMM(Super Mario Maker) project consists of cleaning and editing the data downloaded via [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/leomauro/smmnet), and then transferring this data to the relevant ER diagram. In addition, a basic GUI was created that can connect to the database, retrieve data and display this data using python's tkinter library.

You can use the [exportCode](https://github.com/gayecolakoglu/SMM/tree/main/exportCode) link to export relevant data.
You can use [GUI](https://github.com/gayecolakoglu/SMM/tree/main/GUI) link to reach GUI codes.
You can use the [editCodes](https://github.com/gayecolakoglu/SMM/tree/main/editCodes) link to access the codes where the downloaded data is cleaned and arranged to fit the ER diagram.
You can also use [ER](https://github.com/gayecolakoglu/SMM/tree/main/ER) link to reach the relevant ER diagram.
